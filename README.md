# React-Native-Project-LowCalChow-2023

Pre-requisites:
    - Node.js (Latest Version)
    - Expo Go (App for Android/iOS)

To start this project, you'll need to install [Expo Go](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwiL-auCi6eBAxV5ELMAHXa7AR4YABAAGgJ5bQ&gclid=CjwKCAjwu4WoBhBkEiwAojNdXgKOGn71ikbzUpT9Ap2WNOVKBUmmK-3IfbjZcDbwCm58AVWJ5RyrqRoCHdcQAvD_BwE&ei=rmcBZZ--COmiptQP8uat2AE&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESbeD2-f49dIj3UCEdjtMJ1e59dlPIs_wkQ4kKRuL7NDHlWKvdzbJZP3AN9WLDWv8wWPz4llApZxKu9sEvgoFg5zP_IaXHs6sl-4A36HWsHubasa_-q8lbnwhyCTJ-HzKqxeBh0s-02k_fJ5QVdqs&sig=AOD64_3EjL7HeU97VbvsZaezEj_uXxb_ow&q&sqi=2&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwifzaOCi6eBAxVpkYkEHXJzCxsQ0Qx6BAgKEAE) on a mobile device or an Android/iOS emulator like BlueStacks. Expo will ask you to create a free account. 

Change your directory to the project repo, and use the command `npx expo start` to start the Expo server. Then, if the device you've installed Expo Go on is connected to the same Wi-Fi, you should be able to connect to the server via the app. You can do this by either manually entering the "exp" URL, or scanning the QR code that generates when the server starts. 

From there, you should see the app appear on your device in the Expo Go app. Any edits made to the app while the server is up will be reflected in real time (after the files are saved).
